# 3DtoxV2
3DtoxV2 Opensource firmware

# Description
3D printers are emitting micro particules when extruding plastics.
Depending on the extruded plastic, and the printing temperature, the generated micro particules will vary in size, quantity.
Moreover, the types of generated particules will also vary from materials to another.

3Dtox V2 purpose is to pump up all the generated particules the closest possible of the 3D printer hot end nozzle.
It will also filter all the micro particules in a dedicated composite filter capable of filtering both dust size particules and gaz size micro particules.

It's filter is a standard ABEK filter from 3M.
The device can be modified in order to use different kind of filter consumable to fit your needs.

The 3Dtox V2 also comes with a air quality sensor capable os sensing PM1 micro particules.
